    <img src="../images/carbonara.jpg">
    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its<br> signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta.<br> The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot enough to cook<br> the eggs, but not so hot that they curdle. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound guanciale (cured pork cheek), diced</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese, divided</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale. Cook,<br> turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes.<br> Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.</li>

        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water,<br> stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and<br> return to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl<br> until smooth and creamy.</li>

        <li>Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled.<br> Stir in guanciale. Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese and more black<br> pepper.</li>
    </ol>
