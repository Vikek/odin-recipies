    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe<br> produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few<br> ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better<br> than the boxed stuff).</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well<br> in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>

        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the<br> batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook<br> until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook<br> until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
